                    <h2>Targeted Drug Design</h2>
                    <p>
Targeted drug design develops molecules that interact with biological targets like proteins or enzymes for therapeutic effects. To overcome challenges like low synthetic accessibility, we created a fragment-based ligand design algorithm. This approach integrates active fragment generation and molecular reconstruction, using ordered fragmentation and reconstruction to train sequence-to-sequence and language models. Our model incorporates target contribution perception and a Bag-of-Words classifier, enhancing protein binding site awareness and interpretability. Pretrained on large-scale datasets, it excels in binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility. A simulated annealing algorithm fine-tunes molecular properties, improving efficiency and reducing drug development costs.                    </p>

                    <p>
Drug response prediction is key to personalized medicine, identifying cell reactions to treatments. To improve accuracy, we propose a gene expression-based model using self-supervised learning to integrate gene expression data, gene interaction networks, and molecular structures. This enhances drug sensitivity predictions and supports clinical applications, advancing personalized treatment strategies.                    </p>

                    <h2>Covalent Drug Design</h2>
                    <p>
Covalent drug design develops irreversible inhibitors that form strong bonds with target proteins. CovaGEN, a deep generative method using a reinforced latent diffusion model, designs drug molecules with high binding affinity, drug-likeness, safety, and covalent binding ability. Pre-trained on millions of drug-like molecules, it ensures chemical validity and synthetic accessibility. It integrates protein sequence encoding for target affinity and a covalent warhead-guided mechanism for binding. Reinforcement learning optimizes safety, reducing toxicity by 12% while improving drug-likeness by 31% and synthetic accessibility by 7%. For EGFR T790M and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, over half of the designed inhibitors show strong binding potential, highlighting CovaGEN’s value.                    </p>
